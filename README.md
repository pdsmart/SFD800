# SFD800
A Floppy Disk Interface card for the Sharp MZ series of machines (MZ-80B/MZ-800/MZ-1500/MZ-2000/MZ-2200).

This project reproduces an iconic floppy disk interface card from the 1980's. As floppy disks were expensive in those days, not many interface cards or floppy 
disk drives existed and even fewer survived. As the Sharp MZ series machines, like many of the old computers, are still used and in many ways making a comeback,
the need for a floppy disk interface is needed in order to use the machines.

Please see my website, https://eaw.app for more documentation and any recent updates. This interface has been well tested and used in many machines, a validated design.
